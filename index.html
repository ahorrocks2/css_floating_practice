      <h2>WHO IS MITCHELL?</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Mitchell. I would like to say the name Mitchell was inspired by something, but the reality is someone just gave it to me. I liked it and it stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I'm an experienced mountain and friend based in North Carolina. By day, I work at being the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi. By night, I like hanging out with friends. I really need to start listening to some new music, please feel free to make some recommendations.
      </p>

      I'm also part of the Blue Ridge Mountain team. A free set of mountains that consists of some awesome trails. It would be great to see you at the next one.
